## I see a warning popup when running the installation program.

LADA is a personal project and may trigger a warning during installation due to the absence of an app certificate.

You can proceed with the installation by ignoring the warning.


## Is LADA certified by Riot Games?

No, it is not. Since it is still in the development version, certification requests have not been made yet.


## Where can I make inquiries?

If you are not a developer, please send an email to `2skydev@gmail.com`.


## The app screen size is too large...
